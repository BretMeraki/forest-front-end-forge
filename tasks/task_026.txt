# Task ID: 26
# Title: Implement Basic API Security
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 23
# Priority: high
# Description: Add authentication, rate limiting, and request validation to protect API endpoints before public deployment
# Details:
As specified in the PRD for Phase 4, implement basic API security:

1. Implement authentication mechanism:
   - Add JWT-based authentication for API endpoints
   - Configure secure token management
   - Create middleware for authentication validation
   - Implement proper user session handling

2. Add rate limiting to prevent abuse:
   - Implement per-user or per-IP rate limiting
   - Configure different limits for different endpoint types
   - Create graceful handling for rate limit exceeded scenarios
   - Log rate limiting events for monitoring

3. Enhance request validation:
   - Add comprehensive validation for all incoming requests
   - Implement error handling for malformed requests
   - Add sanitization for user inputs to prevent injection attacks
   - Return standardized error responses

4. Configure CORS settings:
   - Set up proper CORS configuration for the React frontend
   - Limit allowed origins to trusted domains
   - Configure appropriate headers and methods
   - Test cross-origin request handling

5. Add security headers:
   - Configure Content-Security-Policy
   - Add X-Content-Type-Options
   - Set X-Frame-Options
   - Configure other security headers as appropriate

This basic security implementation will protect the application when deployed to public environments like Koyeb, while maintaining API accessibility for legitimate users.
