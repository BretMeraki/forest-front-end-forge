# Title: Deploy MVP to Koyeb and Conduct Self-Evaluation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 28
# Priority: high
# Description: Deploy the application to Koyeb production environment and conduct thorough self-testing to gather insights and validate the MVP
# Details:
Execute the final deployment and conduct self-evaluation of the MVP:

1. Deploy to Koyeb production environment:
   - Follow the deployment guide created in Task #28
   - Configure all required environment variables
   - Set up database connections and perform migrations
   - Configure domains and SSL certificates
   - Verify successful deployment with health checks

2. Conduct comprehensive self-testing:
   - Create multiple test trees with different goals and complexities
   - Complete tasks and trigger phase transitions
   - Test the full user journey multiple times
   - Verify manifest-HTA consistency throughout
   - Evaluate the "Fun & Joy" aspects of the experience
   - Test performance under various conditions

3. Monitor production metrics:
   - Track LLM API usage, costs, and performance
   - Monitor response times and system load
   - Analyze database performance and growth
   - Identify any performance bottlenecks or issues
   - Track user engagement metrics

4. Document findings and insights:
   - Create a detailed evaluation report
   - Identify strengths and areas for improvement
   - Document any unexpected behavior or issues
   - Capture user feedback and observations
   - Prioritize post-MVP enhancements

5. Create a roadmap for future development:
   - Identify high-value features for next iterations
   - Document technical debt to be addressed
   - Propose optimizations based on performance data
