# Task ID: 17
# Title: P4.1: Implement UX, Performance & Branding Optimizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: critical
# Description: Apply critical fixes and refinements based on P3 Validation Sprint feedback, focusing on usability, performance, and full alignment with the Voice & Tone Guide, as per PRD v4.0.
# Details:
1. **UX & Performance Refinement Checkpoint (PRD Sec 8-P4):
   - Review P3 validation report (Task #P3.2). Prioritize and implement fixes.
2. **LLM Operations & UI Copy (PRD Sec 5, 7, 8-P4):
   - Refine LLM prompts for efficiency AND ensure strict alignment with the finalized Voice & Tone Guide (Task #P3.2).
   - Update ALL user-facing UI copy (error messages, notifications, button labels, onboarding text in Streamlit) to be fully consistent with the Voice & Tone Guide.
3. **UI Component Optimization (Streamlit) (PRD Sec 7):
   - Address P3 usability issues. If roadmap display with 10-20 nodes was slow, investigate optimization (Streamlit doesn't have easy virtualization; consider simpler display or pagination if truly problematic). Ensure animations/transitions are smooth.
4. **Re-validate Key Fixes:** Informally with 1-2 original P3 testers if major changes were made.

# Test Strategy:
Targeted testing of all fixes. Re-run key P3 test scenarios. Performance profile optimized areas. Thorough review of all UI text against Voice & Tone Guide.
