# Task ID: 41
# Title: Implement UX Validation Sprint and Refinement Checkpoint
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19, 33
# Priority: high
# Description: Plan and execute the UX Validation Sprint at the end of P3 and UX Refinement Checkpoint at the start of P4 as specified in PRD v3.16
# Details:
As specified in PRD v3.16 sections P3 and P4, implement a structured UX validation process:\n\n1. Plan and execute UX Validation Sprint (End of P3 - Last 2 days):\n   - Recruit 3-5 target users (non-developers) for testing\n   - Create a structured test protocol focusing on:\n     - Core loop: task completion â†’ expansions\n     - Review & confirmation of re-scope diffs\n     - Reaction to basic \"next phase\" notification\n   - Prepare testing environment and materials\n   - Set up recording methods for user interactions\n   - Schedule and conduct test sessions\n   - Document and analyze findings\n   - Produce deliverable: Top 3 usability issues and prioritized tweaks for P4\n\n2. Implement UX Refinement Checkpoint (Start of P4 - First 1-2 days):\n   - Recruit same testers or 2 fresh users\n   - Create test protocol focusing on:\n     - Verification of P3 usability fixes\n     - End-to-end core flow intuition assessment\n   - Schedule and conduct test sessions\n   - Analyze results to determine UX readiness\n   - Produce deliverable: Sign-off on UX readiness for beta or list of critical remaining UX blockers\n\n3. Create test scenarios for core user flows:\n   - Onboarding and initial roadmap generation\n   - Task completion and expansion triggers\n   - Phase completion notification and acknowledgment\n   - Re-scoping with preview and confirmation\n   - Error handling and recovery (e.g., manifest generation failures)\n\n4. Develop user testing materials:\n   - Test scripts and instructions\n   - Task prompts for users to follow\n   - Post-test questionnaires\n   - Observer checklists\n\n5. Implement feedback collection tools:\n   - Recording mechanisms (screen and audio)\n   - Observation note templates\n   - Rating scales for specific aspects\n   - Methods for tracking task success/failure\n\n6. Create analysis framework:\n   - Categorization system for usability issues\n   - Severity rating scale\n   - Impact vs. effort prioritization matrix\n   - Templates for reporting findings\n\n7. Establish rapid iteration process:\n   - Quick turnaround for critical fixes\n   - Validation of fixes with users\n   - Documentation of before/after states\n\nThis structured UX validation approach will ensure the MVP meets user needs and expectations before proceeding to production deployment. The clear checkpoints and deliverables align with the PRD v3.16 emphasis on targeted UX validation for the MVP.
