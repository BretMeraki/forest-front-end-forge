Onboarding service for The Forest application.

This module implements the simplified onboarding process for the Lean MVP as specified in PRD v3.15.
Initially focusing on basic goal and context parsing without complex Q&A flows.

[LeanMVP - Simplify]: For initial P1, focusing on direct goal + context parsing without 
dynamic or predefined Q&A. The Q&A structure is maintained for easy extension in P2/P3.
